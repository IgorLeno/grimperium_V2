# Special requirements:
#   - csharp: Requires the presence of a .sln file in the project folder.
#   - pascal: Requires Free Pascal Compiler (fpc) and optionally Lazarus.
# When using multiple languages, the first language server that supports a given file will be used for that file.
# The first language is the default language and the respective language server will be used as a fallback.
# Note that when using the JetBrains backend, language servers are not used and this list is correspondingly ignored.

# Below is the complete list of tools for convenience.
# To make sure you have the latest list of tools, and to view their descriptions, 
# execute `uv run scripts/print_tool_overview.py`.
#
#  * `activate_project`: Activates a project by name.
#  * `check_onboarding_performed`: Checks whether project onboarding was already performed.
#  * `create_text_file`: Creates/overwrites a file in the project directory.
#  * `delete_lines`: Deletes a range of lines within a file.
#  * `delete_memory`: Deletes a memory from Serena's project-specific memory store.
#  * `execute_shell_command`: Executes a shell command.
#  * `find_referencing_code_snippets`: Finds code snippets in which the symbol at the given location is referenced.
#  * `find_referencing_symbols`: Finds symbols that reference the symbol at the given location (optionally filtered by type).
#  * `find_symbol`: Performs a global (or local) search for symbols with/containing a given name/substring (optionally filtered by type).
#  * `get_current_config`: Prints the current configuration of the agent, including the active and available projects, tools, contexts, and modes.
#  * `get_symbols_overview`: Gets an overview of the top-level symbols defined in a given file.
#  * `initial_instructions`: Gets the initial instructions for the current project.
#     Should only be used in settings where the system prompt cannot be set,
#     e.g. in clients you have no control over, like Claude Desktop.
#  * `insert_after_symbol`: Inserts content after the end of the definition of a given symbol.
#  * `insert_at_line`: Inserts content at a given line in a file.
#  * `insert_before_symbol`: Inserts content before the beginning of the definition of a given symbol.
#  * `list_dir`: Lists files and directories in the given directory (optionally with recursion).
#  * `list_memories`: Lists memories in Serena's project-specific memory store.
#  * `onboarding`: Performs onboarding (identifying the project structure and essential tasks, e.g. for testing or building).
#  * `prepare_for_new_conversation`: Provides instructions for preparing for a new conversation (in order to continue with the necessary context).
#  * `read_file`: Reads a file within the project directory.
#  * `read_memory`: Reads the memory with the given name from Serena's project-specific memory store.
#  * `remove_project`: Removes a project from the Serena configuration.
#  * `replace_lines`: Replaces a range of lines within a file with new content.
#  * `replace_symbol_body`: Replaces the full definition of a symbol.
#  * `restart_language_server`: Restarts the language server, may be necessary when edits not through Serena happen.
#  * `search_for_pattern`: Performs a search for a pattern in the project.
#  * `summarize_changes`: Provides instructions for summarizing the changes made to the codebase.
#  * `switch_modes`: Activates modes by providing a list of their names
#  * `think_about_collected_information`: Thinking tool for pondering the completeness of collected information.
#  * `think_about_task_adherence`: Thinking tool for determining whether the agent is still on track with the current task.
#  * `think_about_whether_you_are_done`: Thinking tool for determining whether the task is truly completed.
#  * `write_memory`: Writes a named memory (for future reference) to Serena's project-specific memory store.

initial_prompt: |
  You are the Code Agent for Grimperium (Delta Learning ML Ensemble Framework).
  
  PROJECT CONTEXT:
  Name: Grimperium - CREST PM7 Optimization Framework
  Phase: Phase A (Threshold Monitoring + Timeout Prediction - ACTIVE)
  Language: Python 3.10+
  Status: Production-Ready (core Phase A components implemented)
  
  ARCHITECTURE:
  - src/grimperium/crest_pm7/ = Core Phase A (conformer_generator, threshold_monitor, timeout_predictor, validation, pipeline)
  - src/grimperium/models/ = Delta-learning ML models (BaseModel, KernelRidgeModel, XGBoostModel, delta_ensemble) - Phase B
  - src/grimperium/utils/ = Helpers and utilities
  - tests/unit/ + tests/integration/ = Test suite (85%+ coverage required)
  - docs/ = CLAUDE.md (your guide), PHASE-A-* (execution guides)
  - data/molecules_pm7/ = Test molecules (thermo_cbs_clean.csv) + logs
  
  CODE STANDARDS (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
  ✅ Type hints: 100% of functions/methods (Python 3.10+ syntax)
  ✅ Docstrings: Google-style on ALL public functions/classes
  ✅ Tests: Comprehensive unit + integration tests for all new code
  ✅ Coverage: Minimum 85% (pytest --cov)
  ✅ Linting: Pre-commit compliance (ruff, black, mypy - NO WARNINGS)
  ✅ Pre-commit hooks: Must pass before commit
  
  WHAT TO ALWAYS DO:
  ✅ Run: pytest tests/ -v --cov=src/grimperium
  ✅ Run: ruff check src/ tests/
  ✅ Run: black src/ tests/
  ✅ Run: mypy src/ --strict
  ✅ Run: pre-commit run --all-files
  ✅ Commit messages: type(scope): description (e.g., feat(crest_pm7): add threshold monitor)
  ✅ No code goes to production without tests passing 100%
  
  WHAT TO NEVER DO:
  ❌ TODOs, XXX, or FIXME comments in code
  ❌ Ignore type hints or docstrings
  ❌ Commit without running tests/linting
  ❌ Change project structure without explicit approval
  ❌ Add dependencies without prior approval
  ❌ Delete code without backup/branch
  ❌ Use browser storage APIs (localStorage, sessionStorage)
  
  PHASE A SCOPE:
  ✅ IMPLEMENT: threshold_monitor.py, timeout_predictor.py, validation, pipeline
  ✅ TEST: Unit + integration tests for Phase A components
  ✅ DO NOT: Data loading (Phase B), Model training (Phase B), MOPAC integration (Phase B)
  
  PHASE B AVAILABLE (Not yet integrated):
  - src/grimperium/models/base_model.py
  - src/grimperium/models/kernel_ridge.py
  - src/grimperium/models/xgboost_model.py
  - src/grimperium/models/delta_ensemble.py
  These are production-ready but Phase A focus is on core workflow validation.
  
  KEY WORKFLOWS:
  - Git: Branch naming = feature/*, fix/*, refactor/*
  - Testing: All new code must have tests passing before merge
  - Linting: Pre-commit hooks catch issues before commit
  - Review: Code changes require validation against Phase A success criteria
